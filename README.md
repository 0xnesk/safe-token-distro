# GnosisDAO SAFE token distribution to incentivize decentralizing Gnosis Chain
https://forum.gnosis.io/t/gip-64-should-gnosisdao-distribute-safe-tokens-to-incentivize-decentralizing-gnosis-chain/5896


### Simple Summary
As decided in GIP-29, GnosisDAO is receiving 15% of the total SAFE token supply over a period of 4 years. We suggest using the SAFE tokens to support the main objective of GnosisDAO: Making the Gnosis Chain successful. We want to position Gnosis Chain as the most decentralized network available. To support this objective, we suggest distributing the SAFE tokens as additional yield to those participating in staking on the Gnosis Beacon Chain.

We suggest the following distribution:

- Equal distribution of vested SAFE tokens to GNO holders on a monthly basis until the end of the locking period (February 15, 2023, about 0.9% of all SAFE tokens).
- Eligible GNO:
  - GNO in locking contracts on Ethereum and Gnosis Chain.
  - GNO used by individual stakers.
  - GNO/sGNO staked in the gauge on curve 53
- After the end of the locking period: Use up to 9.1% of the remaining SAFE tokens as additional yield for stakers on the Gnosis Beacon Chain over the remaining vesting period. The distribution should be based on the importance of the different staking categories:
  - individual stakers (e.g. dappnode users)
  - distributed liquid staking (e.g. rocket pool users)
  - professional staking services (e.g. chorus.one)
  - liquid staking (e.g. stakewise, lido))

The concrete distribution should be decided based on the staking options available at the end of the locking period and will be subject to continuous adoption to reach the goal of decentralizing the network.
